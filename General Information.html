Myanmar is the largest country in the Southeast Asia  region, bounded by mountain complex in the north, east and west, and enclosed  by the Andamen Sea and the Bay of Bengal in the south, southwest, and west.  Myanmar shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand.  Situated between latitudes 9. 30&rsquo; N and 28. 30&rsquo; N and between longitudes 92.  10&rsquo; E and 101. 10&rsquo; E the country stretches 2090 km north to south, and 925 km  east to west   and has a varied  topography which includes islands, extensive rice plains, river valleys and  forested hills and mountains.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a 2,832 km long coastline on the Indian Ocean.  Myanmar's highest mountains, situated in the far north, include Hkakabo Razi,  the tallest peak both locally and in the region, which rises 5,881 km above sea  level. The two other mountain systems: a group of low mountains called the  Rakhine Yoma stands in the west forming a border with the Indian Subcontinent,  and the hilly Shan Plateau separates Myanmar from China, Laos and Thailand.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central lowland region of Myanmar consists of the  Ayeyarwaddy (Irrawaddy)   and Sittaung  river valleys. Ayeyarwaddy is the longest river in the country running for  2,010 km from the northern region to the Bay of Bengal, and serves as the  principle transportation route and as the main source of water supply for the  central dry zone.</p>

The heavy rainfall is brought by seasonal winds called monsoons, which sweep northeastward from the Indian Ocean. The cool season runs from late October to mid-February. Temperatures are  lowest at this time, though the climate remains tropical throughout most  of Myanmar.  The hot season lasts from late February to about mid-May. During this season, temperatures often top 100 °F (38 °C) in many parts of Myanmar.</p></td>

But it respects the freedom of belief and the people practice religious tolerance on other religions which is evident in the existence of religious buildings of different beliefs in large cities. Myanmar lies between two great civilizations, India and China, and is largely influenced by that of India, yet Myanmar has developed its own culture with distinctive characteristics. The unique thing about Myanmar culture is that it is free from racial or sex discrimination from childbirth  throughout the lifetime.</p></td>
